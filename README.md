This is a new test I made to create a calculator
with multiple functions in different files.
You can download the source code, and compile
it with :
'gcc main.c division.c multiplication.c addition.c substraction.c modulus.c -o filename'
This is still a work in progress !!!
Do not try to input a letter when asked for a number
you WILL face an infinite loop.
